# Step-by-Step Guide:
# Setup Environment:

# Install necessary packages: dask, pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, cryptography (for encryption), and any other libraries you might need.
# Initialize a Dask client for distributed computing.
# python
# from dask.distributed import Client
# client = Client()
# Data Encryption Before Entering DCR:

#I dont think encryption/Decryption is done by us the file is given we will use that


# Encrypt the data from publishers and advertisers before it enters the DCR to ensure privacy.
# Use a symmetric encryption algorithm like AES.
# python

# from Crypto.Cipher import AES
# from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes
# import pandas as pd
# import base64

# def encrypt_data(data, key):
#     cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX)
#     ciphertext, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(data.encode('utf-8'))
#     return base64.b64encode(cipher.nonce + tag + ciphertext).decode('utf-8')

# key = get_random_bytes(16)  # AES key
# Decrypt Data Inside DCR:

# Decrypt the data inside the DCR to allow for analysis and model training.
# python
# def decrypt_data(encrypted_data, key):
#     data = base64.b64decode(encrypted_data.encode('utf-8'))
#     nonce, tag, ciphertext = data[:16], data[16:32], data[32:]
#     cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX, nonce=nonce)
#     return cipher.decrypt_and_verify(ciphertext, tag).decode('utf-8')
# Load and Preprocess Data:

# Load the encrypted data into the DCR, decrypt it, and preprocess it as needed.
# python
# # Example loading and decryption
# encrypted_data_publisher = ...  # Load encrypted data from publishers
# encrypted_data_advertiser = ...  # Load encrypted data from advertisers

# decrypted_data_publisher = decrypt_data(encrypted_data_publisher, key)
# decrypted_data_advertiser = decrypt_data(encrypted_data_advertiser, key)

# df_publisher = pd.read_csv(decrypted_data_publisher)
# df_advertiser = pd.read_csv(decrypted_data_advertiser)
# Generate Synthetic Data with GenAI:

# Use a generative AI model to create synthetic data that mimics the real data but ensures privacy.
# You might use models like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) or other generative models.
# python

# # Example placeholder for synthetic data generation
# from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# # Split the data into training and testing sets for GAN or other GenAI models
# train_data_publisher, test_data_publisher = train_test_split(df_publisher, test_size=0.2)
# train_data_advertiser, test_data_advertiser = train_test_split(df_advertiser, test_size=0.2)

# # Train your generative model here and generate synthetic data
# synthetic_data_publisher = ...  # Generated synthetic data for publisher
# synthetic_data_advertiser = ...  # Generated synthetic data for advertiser
# Encrypt Data Before Sending Out of DCR:

# After generating synthetic data, encrypt it before sending it out of the DCR.
# python

# encrypted_synthetic_data_publisher = encrypt_data(synthetic_data_publisher.to_csv(index=False), key)
# encrypted_synthetic_data_advertiser = encrypt_data(synthetic_data_advertiser.to_csv(index=False), key)
# Run Aggregated Statistics:

# Perform statistical analysis on the decrypted synthetic data to derive insights.
# Example: Age distribution, geographic distribution, device usage, etc.
# python

# # Example: Age group distribution
# age_distribution = df_publisher['age'].value_counts()
# Train Predictive Models:

# Train multiple machine learning models using the synthetic data for tasks like CTR prediction.
# Use scikit-learn or other ML libraries.
# python

# from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
# from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# # Example model training
# X = synthetic_data_publisher.drop('label', axis=1)
# y = synthetic_data_publisher['label']

# model = RandomForestClassifier()
# model.fit(X, y)

# # Evaluate the model
# predictions = model.predict(X)
# accuracy = accuracy_score(y, predictions)
# Present Results:

# Prepare a presentation that includes your methodology, synthetic data generation process, statistical insights, model training, and evaluation results.
# Create 3-5 page slides summarizing your work.
